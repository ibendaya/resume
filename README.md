# Professional Summary

A Sr. Machine Learning Specialist with over 8 years of diverse experience spanning industry, academia, and research. In my most recent role at General Motors, I contributed to AI-driven innovations including NLP-based quality tools, computer vision systems, reinforcement learning for personalization, and data analytics for marketing optimization. Before that I was a PhD student at the University of Waterloo, where my research focused on developing a Conditional Random Field-based ultrasound imaging system, pushing the boundaries of medical imaging technologies. During my doctoral studies, I gained valuable industry insights through internships at Continental Automotive, researched adversarial attacks and defenses on neural networks, and Christie Digital, contributing to cutting-edge display technologies.
